1 lookup = 7 requests + 4 * additional test centers

7 ~ 19 requests / customer

21 lookups per proxy per hour ~= 400 requests per hour


1 look up every 5 minutes = 12 lookups per hour
for 100 customers = 1200 lookups per hour = 22.800 requests

keeping a healthy 400 requests per hour for each proxy that would mean ~57 proxies
pushing a little bit to 500 requests per hour for each proxy that would mean ~45 proxies

so an average of 50 proxies for 100 customers, so 2 customers per proxy

CAPTCHA

Crawling every 5 minutes, 16 hours per day for 30 months = 12 * 16 * 30 = 5760 look ups per month,
at $3.00 for every 1000 reCAPTCHAS would cost $17.28 per customer per month, so for 100 customers that would mean $1728.00 / month
That is assuming every request would mean solving a reCAPTCHA. In my experience with my IP I had to solve a captcha every time
I tried to look up the dates, but with good proxies that may not be the case.
